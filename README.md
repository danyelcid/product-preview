![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out.
This is my solution to the challenge from: [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements
